# BMUX

This app is a simple MacOS toolbar widget that lets one manage and persist browser sessions. This is useful for managing multiple browser windows (i.e. for working on different projects).

Using BMUX is very straightforward. There are three main functions: `Start session`, `Load session`, and `Delete session`.
- `Start session` lets you name a new session. Every 10 seconds, the app will read the URLs that are open in Chrome and Safari and will save them. If your computer shuts down, the session will persist.
- `Load session` lets you load a previously-created session. BMUX will launch a new window with the tabs saved in the session.
- `Delete session` lets you delete a session.
